>For example, far too many of the liberals and “love and peace” hippies of the 1960s, who at the time supported the cause of racial and gender equality and opposed American military interventionism, moved to the right in the 1970s and adopted an edgy version of what I call color-blind racism in this book as their new racial ideology.14

>Nevertheless, despite the resurgence of old-fashioned racism and Trumpism, I still believe that the dominant15 form of systemic racism in America is suave. The systemic racism of the post–civil rights era, which I discuss in detail in chapters 2 and 3, is the “New Racism” characterized by novel discriminatory tactics

>It is the college admissions officer using SAT or ACT scores to make admission decisions even though these tests have a racist origin, are racially biased, and are not good predictors of success in college.17 And it is the White person who does not use the racist language of the past and professes to be a “good person,” yet still calls the police whenever she sees a “suspicious” (Black or Brown) person walking in her neighborhood (the color of suspiciousness in America is highly racialized).

>Despite the crude racialism of Trump and many of his followers, the “I do not see color” argument is the fundamental ideological lyric fitting the “New Racism” music. Color-blind racism is the dominant racial discourse in the nation exemplified by what comes after a White person says, “I am not a racist, but . . .” or “Some of my best friends are Black.” It is the notion that affirmative action amounts to “reverse discrimination.” It is the color-blind White person who curiously lives in a White neighborhood, has only White friends, sends her children to White schools, is a member of a White club, and attends a White church or synagogue and still believes all these things are nonracial events or rational nonracial. In sum, I still posit that racism, in terms of practices and ideas, is not mostly about the rotten apples but about the nice apples, who believe they are “beyond race” yet act, consciously or not, in racialized ways.

>Old-fashioned racism is alive and has unquestionably grown in import, but the “racists” (if we define them as people who overtly say or do racially motivated things) are not the ones preventing people of color getting certain jobs or treating them differently in those jobs, calling 911 to report Black people barbecuing in a park or Black girls selling lemonade in a stand, or choosing to move into White neighborhoods or sending their children to majority-White schools. This is why the title of my book is still Racism Without Racists, as I want to highlight the sophisticated nature of contemporary prejudice (I label “prejudice” racial ideology and explain why in chapters 1 and 2) that most Whites exude these days, including many who claim to be liberal, progressive, and even “woke.”

>If racism is “structural” or “systemic,” one must appreciate that all members of the polity participate in the system, whether they like it or not, or are aware of it. This is the nature of systems or structures. None of us created social systems such as “systemic racism,” patriarchy, or capitalism, but we all participate in these systems of oppression which are part of the American “matrix of domination.”18
